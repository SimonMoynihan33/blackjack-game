          <h2>Rules:</h2>

          <h3>Objective:</h3>
          <p>The goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.</p>

          <h3>Card Values:</h3>
          <p><strong>Number cards:</strong> Face value (e.g., a 7 of Hearts is worth 7 points).</p>
          <p><strong>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack):</strong> Each worth 10 points.</p>
          <p><strong>Ace:</strong> Can be worth 1 or 11 points</p>

          <h3>Game Setup:</h3>
          <p>The game uses one or more standard 52-card decks.</p>
          <p>Players are dealt two cards face up.</p>
          <P>The dealer is dealt two cards: one face up and one face down (the "hole card").</P>

          <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
          <h4>Player Actions:</h4>

          <p><strong>Hit:</strong> Take another card to increase your hand's value.</p>
          <p><strong>Stand:</strong> Keep your current hand and end your turn.</p>
          <p><strong>Double Down:</strong> Double your initial bet and take exactly one more card.</p>
          <p><strong>Split:</strong> If your first two cards have the same value, you can split them into two separate hands (requires doubling your bet).</p>
          <p><strong>Surrender:</strong> Forfeit half your bet and end your round (optional, if allowed).</p>
          <h4>Dealer Actions:</h4>
          <p>The dealer must draw cards (hit) until their hand totals at least 17.</p>
          <p>The dealer must stand on a hand of 17 or more (depending on house rules, they may hit on a "soft 17" — a hand with an Ace counting as 11).</p>

          <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
          <p><strong>Blackjack:</strong> If your first two cards total exactly 21 (e.g., Ace + 10 or face card), you have a "Blackjack" and win 1.5 times your bet (unless the dealer also has Blackjack, which is a tie or "push").</p>
          <p><strong>Closer to 21:</strong> You win if your hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.</p>
          <p><strong>Dealer Busts:</strong> If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, all remaining players win.</p>
          <p><strong>Bust:</strong> If your hand exceeds 21, you automatically lose.</p>
          <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
          <p><strong>Push:</strong> If your hand and the dealer's hand have the same value, it's a tie, and your bet is returned.</p>
          <p><strong>Insurance:</strong> If the dealer’s face-up card is an Ace, you can place an "insurance" bet (half your original bet) to protect against the dealer having Blackjack. If the dealer has Blackjack, the insurance bet pays 2:1 but you lose your original bet.</p>
          <h3>Soft vs. Hard Hands:</h3>
          <p>A soft hand includes an Ace counted as 11 (e.g., Ace + 6 = soft 17).</p>
          <p>A hard hand has no Ace or counts the Ace as 1 (e.g., 10 + 7 = hard 17).</p>
          <h3>Betting</h3>
          <p>Players place their bets before the cards are dealt.</p>
          <p>Minimum and maximum bet limits vary depending on the table or casino.</p>
